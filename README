[USAGE]
	ex <args>
[ARGS]
	-f 		kill process and restart
	-k [s] 	kill or soft kill (killing x2vnc which provides access from current desktop)
	-l 		switch to landscape mode
	-n|s|e|w	set location of vnc server relative main desktop, default: east
	-d <num>	set display number of vncsession, default: 4
	-h			help
	
[DEPENDS]
	vnc4server
	x2vnc

[SETUP]
	* place ex.sh and README in a safe location (~/.vnc is ideal)
	* echo "alias ex=~/.vnc/ex.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

	* edit defaults as desired:
		* GEOMS can contain any number of resolutions
			* second resolution is used by landscape mode
			* subtract ~80 from vertical for use with android tablets

	* configure vncserver desktop session in ~/.vnc/xstartup

	* connect using your favorite vncviewer
		* port will be 5900+<session number> default: 5904
		* for android "Jump Desktop" seems to provide the best interface
			for this kind of session

[DESCRIPTION]
	This is a script designed to simplify startup and interaction with a
	vnc server to be used as if it is a second monitor. This is done
	specifically with tablets in mind as there are currently few documented
	options for configuring such devices in a Linux environment. Note that
	this is achieved by creating a separate desktop session. The main session
	is connected to the vnc server using x2vnc, an apparently little know
	program that creates a window on one side of the main desktop, and sends
	mouse and keyboard input to the vnc server in a similar manner to the
	more well known option, synergy. This script provides the benefit of
	being able to easily interact from the either the main desktop or the
	second device while not messing with the main session and providing all
	the benefits of a configurable second desktop. The ability to cleanly
	switch between widescreen and landscape modes and use the second session
	completely separately from the first are key benefits of the implementation.
	However this method is limited as windows cannot be dragged from one
	session to another. If being able to drag windows to a second device is
	absolutely necessary this script will not be useful. However a good
	option would be to configure the main session desktop to be wider than
	the main monitor in some direction and then connecting via vnc and
	panning to the extra space.
